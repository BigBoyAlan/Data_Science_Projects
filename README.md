### Cryptopunk Price ANOVA Modeling

**Description:**
This project explores the factors affecting the prices of Cryptopunks, a popular non-fungible token (NFT) series, using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It investigates how characteristics like type, skin tone, gender, and the number of accessories relate to their market prices.

**Tools & Techniques Used:**
- R Programming Language
- Libraries: tidyr, ggplot2
- Techniques: Data cleaning and preprocessing, transformations for variance stabilization, exploratory data analysis with boxplots, ANOVA modeling
